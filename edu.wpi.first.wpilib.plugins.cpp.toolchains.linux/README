Making This Plugin Work
=======================

This plugin needs a very big zip that contains the toolchain. This is
currently hosted by Jenkins in the "Windows Toolchain Provider"
project. This can also be created from the download from mentor
embedded. The file should be resources/toolchain.zip and contains the
5 main directories.
